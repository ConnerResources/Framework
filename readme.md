# Multi Theft Auto Framework
This framework was created to facilitate the creation of interfaces within Multi Theft Auto (MTA) for developers. The entire structure of this code was built using metatables for greater flexibility. With a focus on efficiency, we use SVG instead of dxDrawRectangle, dxDrawCircle, and other native functions to improve the code's performance. This framework includes **[the elements](elements)**, which are constantly being updated. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me on Discord at #euconner or via email at connerresources@gmail.com.

Below are the elements of the framework. New elements will be made available soon:
- [Switch](elements/readme.md#switch)
